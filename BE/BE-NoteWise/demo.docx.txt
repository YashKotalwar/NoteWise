Tables in Word can vary from the extremely simple to the extremely complex. calibre tries to do its best when converting tables. 
Two kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those that refer to locations inside the document itself. 
The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. 
The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.
If no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is automatically generated from the headings in the document. 
 You can see the Table of Contents created by calibre by clicking the Table of Contents button in whatever viewer you are using to view the converted ebook. 
Generally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word document to an ebook.
